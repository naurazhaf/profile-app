# Profile App

Welcome to the **Profile App**, a simple and intuitive solution for managing user profiles. The goal of this project is to provide an easy way for users to update their personal details, such as name, email, and other information.

## Current Status:
- The app currently allows users to update various fields like their full name, email, phone number, and more.
- The design is clean and functional, providing a user-friendly interface.

## What's Next:
- The **"Update Profile"** button on the profile card is not yet functional, but we’re actively working on it.
- Future improvements include making the profile card fully editable and introducing more features to enhance user experience.

This project is still under development, but exciting updates are coming soon! Stay tuned for further improvements as we refine the app to make profile management smoother and more efficient.

Here’s the current look:
